## How to contribute
Let's use this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-apps-script-github/lfjcgcmkmjjlieihflfhjopckgpelofo?hl=en

This extension helps push code to and from the google apps script editor to GitHub.
1. Install the chrome extension
1. Go to the Google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x0BDHCvgq7j71Tsj6w8Fsq0GdYdv_VLSoj_8iKkVC0c/edit#gid=0 )
1. Copy the Sheet to your own Google Drive.
1. Go to Tools > Script editor
1. Login to Github using the extension on the Script editor.
1. And it works!

### Coding, testing
To contribute, pull the code using the extension and test it on your copy of the sheet.

### TO use/test
Go the menu, enter a ISBN {paste an example here}

TODO: branch conventions, but probably make your own branch for your stuff and merge to master via PR
